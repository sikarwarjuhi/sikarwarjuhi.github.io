So in this blog I will explain how to remove it, how does it works and why it is 
still not removed by facebook 
<br><br><br>




How to remove
------
So those of you who just came here to see how to remove it, it can be done in
following steps probably

1. Go to chrome settings
2. Click on Extensions in the sidebar
3. Remove a extension called chromesecurity
4. Also remove extensions that you don't remember installing.

Congrats your virus have been removed
<br><br><br>





How it works
------
So it basically host an app on Heroku (Heroku is an app hosting site), So when a user
clicks on the link of the virus, it installs a extension on chrome and that extension 
chooses some of your fb friends.
It downloads their profile photo and name, and then creates a new app on heroku and than 
post that link on their wall.
And the loop continues
<br><br><br>





Why it is still not removed by facebook
------
My guess is as it post videos on some of the friends timeline not all, so it remains undetected
due to low activity
<br><br><br>
